## Setup

### Development

#### Authenticate to the npm package registry

For using the @ts4nfdi/terminology-service-suite you have to [authenticate](https://docs.github.com/de/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#authentifizieren-mit-einem-personal-access-token) with a personal access token or deploy token.
For local development specify a runtime variable NPM_TOKEN with your npm authentication token.

#### Local development

```

Start the development server with:
```
npm start
```
Accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The page will reload when you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.\
We use prettier for code formatting. Run
```
npm run style:format
npm run style:ceck
```
to format or check all files.


### Production

Create production build for all services:  
Uncomment `build: ./` in `docker-compose.yaml`  
Set an environment variable with your NPM_TOKEN.  
Run the following to build the Docker image with the current NPM_TOKEN environment variable.
